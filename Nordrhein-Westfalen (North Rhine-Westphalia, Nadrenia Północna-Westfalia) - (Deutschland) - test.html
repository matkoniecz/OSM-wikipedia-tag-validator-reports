			Wikidata claims that assigned brand object no longer exists. That means that either this shop is gone or it is rebranded. Or brand:wikidata tag is wrong. Historical, no longer existing object should not be mapped in OSM. REMEMBER TO VERIFY! WIKIDATA QUALITY MAY BE POOR! WIKIDATA MUST NOT BE USED AS SOURCE! ALWAYS VERIFY!
